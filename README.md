# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++ (Console)

## Overview
This project is a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C++. It features a user vs. computer mode, a visually formatted grid, and logic for win, lose, and draw conditions. The project demonstrates array manipulation, game logic, and user interaction in C++, reflecting my journey in building interactive console games and improving my programming skills.

## Features
- **User vs. Computer:** Play against a simple AI that makes moves based on the current board state.
- **Formatted Grid:** The game board is displayed using ASCII art for a clear, user-friendly interface.
- **Win/Lose/Draw Detection:** Automatically checks for game-ending conditions after each move.
- **Replay Option:** Option to play again after a win, loss, or draw.
- **Menu and Input Handling:** Prompts for user input and validates choices.

## How It Works
1. **Start Game:** User is prompted to begin the game.
2. **User Turn:** User selects a cell (1-9) to place their 'O'.
3. **Computer Turn:** The AI ('X') makes its move based on available cells and simple strategy.
4. **Check Conditions:** After each move, the game checks for win, lose, or draw.
5. **Replay:** User can choose to play again or exit after the game ends.

## My Learning Journey
Through this project, I learned:
- How to implement game logic and AI in C++.
- Managing 2D arrays for board representation.
- Handling user input and edge cases.
- Creating interactive, replayable console applications.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Compile:** Use a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) to compile `TICTACTOE.cpp`.
   - Example: `g++ TICTACTOE.cpp -o tictactoe`
2. **Run:** Execute the compiled program.
   - Example: `./tictactoe`
3. **Play:** Follow on-screen prompts to play against the computer.

## File Structure
- `TICTACTOE.cpp`: Main source code for the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
- `README.md`: Project overview, features, and instructions.
